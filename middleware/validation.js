/**
 * This file should contain handling for validation on routes. Specifically, I encourage you to use 
 * express-validator to create a function that handles validation errors, specifically a function 
 * that returns a 400 response for malformed input/errored input in the request body with a response json 
 * stating "User input is malformed". If no error exists,
 * function should simply call the next function, allowing for the route to proceed in execution like normal.
 * 
 * Make sure to export the function at the end of the file so you can use it in your routes.
